This is a test excerpt from The Salmon of Doubt:
I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and old af is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
3. Anything invented after you're old af is against the natural order of things.
